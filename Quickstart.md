## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "Cannot find module 'express'"
**Solution:** Run `npm install` in the backend folder

### "Port 5000 already in use"
**Solution:** Either:
- Stop other services using port 5000, or
- Edit `backend/server.js` and change `PORT = 5000` to another number like `5001`

### Frontend shows "Failed to fetch"
**Solution:** Make sure the backend server is running first!

### Browser shows old/cached version
**Solution:** Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
